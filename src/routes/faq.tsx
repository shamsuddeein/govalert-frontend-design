    q: "What is GovAlert?",
    a: "GovAlert is an independent verification platform that monitors Nigerian federal recruitment portals. Our crawlers check endpoints every 15 minutes, and our analysts cross-verify listings to protect job seekers from widespread recruitment scams.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you verify a portal is authentic?",
    a: "We use a multi-phase audit process: (1) Domain analysis, checking that the portal operates on a registered, secure .gov.ng or verified corporate domain extension; (2) SSL examination, confirming the presence of genuine corporate EV certificates; (3) Cross-referencing announcement details against the national gazette, federal budget allocations, or verified MDA media releases.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is GovAlert affiliated with the Federal Government?",
    a: "No. GovAlert is completely independent. We are not government employees, and we do not influence, represent, or sell employment slots. We function solely as a public utility to assure safety and security in recruitment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I pay to apply for listed jobs?",
    a: "Absolutely not. Official government recruitments are free of charge. If any agency portal, recruiter, or third party demands payment for registration, exams, medical checks, or training kits, it is a scam.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the confidence score mean?",
    a: "The confidence score indicates verification certainty. A high score means the portal operates on a verified official government domain with secure HTTPS connections, has no security anomalies, and content matches historical patterns. Scores drop if warning flags like non-standard domains, external redirections, or format deviations are found.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get alerts on Telegram?",
    a: "Click 'Get Alerts' in the navigation menu to connect to our official Telegram channel. You will receive real-time notifications on your phone whenever new recruitments are verified.",
  },
